#  Greetings! ü§ù

<span style="font-size: 16px">

You can call me - **404**.

I am a professional **Frontend developer** üíª. My main **area of expertise** is the development of the **client-side** of commercial-oriented applications using a diverse technology stack, including ***JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Vue,*** and other cutting-edge technologies for building large-scale web services. I work on projects ranging from landing pages to small-scale social networks.

Here I share various interesting personal projects that I have had the opportunity to work on as part of my study and immersion in the field of development.

***Examples of my projects üìã:***

- [**SimpleFeedBack**](https://github.com/nenaideno/SimpleFeedBack) - 
The concept of the service is to enable the quick generation of feedback forms with custom design based on a specific template.

- [**Lonely Sakura**](https://github.com/nenaideno/Sakura-novel) - A short visual novel developed as part of a hackathon. It was quite an interesting experience building the [**RenPy**](https://www.renpy.org/) engine for the [**web**](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/web.html).

- [**HowLong2Bot**](https://github.com/nenaideno/HowLong2Bot) - This is a bot for the streaming service [**Twitch.tv**](https://www.twitch.tv/). It allows you to find out the playtime of a game specified in the stream's category. It utilizes the service [**howlongtobeat.com**](https://howlongtobeat.com/) for this purpose.

- [**DotaRateTracker**](https://github.com/nenaideno/DotaRateTracker) - Not quite my project... As part of this experiment, I was testing the capabilities of [**ChatGPT**](https://chat.openai.com/) in generating working code. This repository is the result of the research and work of the neural network.

In the future, this list will be updated and changed, as I am constantly evolving and seeking something new.

**Thank you for your attention. üôè**
