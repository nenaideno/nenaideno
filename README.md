## Examples of my projects üìã

- [**Autoinnovatic**](https://autoinnovatic.ru/) - A project that is a social network for people who want to show the world their idea and find associates to bring it to life. (Currently - only in Russian.)

- [**SimpleFeedBack**](https://github.com/nenaideno/SimpleFeedBack) - A service that enables the quick generation of feedback forms with custom design based on specific templates.

- [**SimpleToDo**](https://github.com/nenaideno/SimpleToDo) - A simple web application for managing to-do items. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete to-do items in a list

- [**Gimme your password**](https://github.com/nenaideno/gimmeyourpassword) - A simple mini-game in which you need to create a password that meets every criterion. At first, it's easy, but can you make it to the end?... (Currently available only in Russian.)

It utilizes the service [**howlongtobeat.com**](https://howlongtobeat.com/) for this purpose.

- [**Lonely Sakura**](https://github.com/nenaideno/Sakura-novel) - A short visual novel developed as part of a hackathon. It was quite an interesting experience building the [**RenPy**](https://www.renpy.org/) engine for the [**web**](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/web.html).
