## Examples of my projects üìã

- [**Lonely Sakura**](https://github.com/nenaideno/Sakura-novel) - A short visual novel developed as part of a hackathon. It was quite an interesting experience building the [**RenPy**](https://www.renpy.org/) engine for the [**web**](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/web.html).

- [**HowLong2Bot**](https://github.com/nenaideno/HowLong2Bot) - A bot for the streaming service [**Twitch.tv**](https://www.twitch.tv/) that allows you to find out the playtime of a game specified in the stream's category. It utilizes the service [**howlongtobeat.com**](https://howlongtobeat.com/) for this purpose.
